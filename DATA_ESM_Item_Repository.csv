examples: 
- ask your colleagues if you want to do something together tonight. you ask your partner if this is all right. you don't want to be independent of your partner's consent, as this will relieve you of the decision.
- you would like to complete a task, but you are dependent on the help of your partner. you do not want to solve the task alone, but only with the help of your partner, even if you have an equally good and equally complex alternative.
- you are just waiting for your partner to pick you up for an event. you don't want to be independent of your partner's pickup, because then you don't have to worry about the route. 

if you are already acting independently of your partner, please indicate whether you wish to continue or explicitly no longer wish to do so.

the desire ('yes' answers) refers to whether you want to influence your partner with the aim of influencing his thoughts, feelings or actions and experiencing your own effectiveness through an effect on your partner.
important: the goal here is not to achieve another goal with the influence (for example, that you receive affection), but the successful influence itself is the goal.
examples:
- your partner is currently in a certain mood, e.g. depressed. you want to change this mood, e.g. make your partner feel better.
- your partner is currently indifferent to a topic, e.g. a joint activity. you would like to trigger his interest and committed behaviour.

in the case of an aversion (last possible answer), you explicitly do not want to exert influence, you want to avoid this.
examples:
- your partner is currently in a certain mood, e.g. happy. you want to avoid changing this mood, e.g. avoid your partner being worse off.
- your partner is currently indifferent to a topic, e.g. a joint activity. you want to avoid arousing his interest.

if you already have an influence on your partner, please indicate whether you wish to continue or explicitly no longer wish to do so.

important: the goal here is not to achieve another goal with the influence (for example, that you receive affection), but the successful influence itself is the goal.
examples:
- your partner is currently in a certain mood, e.g. depressed. you want to change this mood, e.g. make your partner feel better.
- your partner is currently indifferent to a topic, e.g. a joint activity. you would like to trigger his interest and committed behaviour.

in the case of an aversion (last possible answer), you explicitly do not want to exert influence, you want to avoid this.
examples:
- your partner is currently in a certain mood, e.g. happy. you want to avoid changing this mood, e.g. avoid your partner being worse off.
- your partner is currently indifferent to a topic, e.g. a joint activity. you want to avoid arousing his interest.

the desire ('yes' answers) refers to whether you want your partner to show emotional affection, such as appreciation or an expression of love. 

if you have an aversion (last possible answer) you explicitly do not want to receive emotional affection (e.g. appreciation, expression of love), you want to avoid this. 

if you are already receiving affection from your partner, please indicate whether you wish this to continue or explicitly no longer wish to have it that way.
